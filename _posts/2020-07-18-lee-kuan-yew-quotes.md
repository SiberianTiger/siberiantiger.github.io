> 1967, Interview by NBC, "Meet the Press", https://youtu.be/VexrmTacOAA

First of all, I can't speak as a Chinese because I'm a Singaporean. I'm of Chinese ethnic stock. I think this is crucial. I mean, if you ask me to speak as a Chinese, well you know, the People's Republic in Peking will be, I think, quite rightfully indignant. So will the other aspirant in Taipei. But speaking as a Singaporean with some of the built-in memory, programming of the Chinese people, I would say that...

The young must be idealistic. The young must believe that the world should be more just and that there should be more moral rectitude in the behaviors of their leaders. They protest often, in more than just a peaceful manner, because the communists slipped into my demonstrations. Windows got broken so often, and cars got overturned. But at the end of the day, I think decisions have got to be made by adults not teenagers. But it's got to be made in such a way that when the teenagers become adults and they look back on these decision, they would be proud of the generation that went before them.

And let there be no mistakes about it. Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him, or give it up. This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine. I spent a whole life time building this. And as long as I’m in charge, nobody’s going to knock it down.

Supposing we have made Mandarin our first language, then I tell you, apart from domestic troubles with our Malays and our Tamils that are non-Chinese, what is the use of Singaporeans to China? They don't need another 3 million Chinese speaking people. They've got 1,300 million, 23 million in Taiwan, 7 million in Hong Kong. 3 million more speaking Chinese, what value is it to them? But because we have English, because we have access to the English speaking world, and knowledge that goes with it, and the commercial and economic contexts that we have developed, and the links that we have over the years evolved with the world in general, not just the English speaking world, but the world that now uses English as a common language. That's why we are useful.
