> 1967, Interview by NBC, "Meet the Press", https://youtu.be/VexrmTacOAA

First of all, I can't speak as a Chinese because I'm a Singaporean. I'm of Chinese ethnic stock. I think this is crucial. I mean, if you ask me to speak as a Chinese, well you know, the People's Republic in Peking will be, I think, quite rightfully indignant. So will the other aspirant in Taipei. But speaking as a Singaporean with some of the built-in memory, programming of the Chinese people, I would say that...

The young must be idealistic. The young must believe that the world should be more just and that there should be more moral rectitude in the behaviors of their leaders. They protest often, in more than just a peaceful manner, because the communists slipped into my demonstrations. Windows got broken so often, and cars got overturned. But at the end of the day, I think decisions have got to be made by adults not teenagers. But it's got to be made in such a way that when the teenagers become adults and they look back on these decision, they would be proud of the generation that went before them.

And let there be no mistakes about it. Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him, or give it up. This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine. I spent a whole lifetime building this. And as long as I’m in charge, nobody’s going to knock it down.

On the whole, it (British decolonization) has been a disappointing exercise. I remember as a student in Britain, being taught constitutional law by a very distinguished professor who had been one of Churchill's cabinet secretaries. And he illustrated with an example of Ceylon how the ideal transition to democracy and self-government would take place. They had their first municipal elections in 1932 for mayor of Colombo and a council of Colombo. They had two universities that ... of professionals and administrative officers. They had large ... . So they started off with all the advantages that would ensure progress and prosperity. Of course I was taught this in 1947, when Ceylon had just got independence. And India, of course, had just gone into turmoil, with breakup into Pakistan and India. 

I have never believed that democracy brings progress. I know it to have brought regression. I watched it year by year, every two years when I meet my fellow members of, leaders of the Commonwealth. And it need not have been thus. The British never governed these countries by One Man One Vote. It was one British government, one British resident, and his word was law, and yet good district officers whose word was also law for that district. I think regardless of the present missionary zeal of the Americans of democracy and human rights, which has broken up the Soviet Union, it would be misguided to believe that what has worked in very special circumstances amongst European societies, and what is barely working in Korea and Taiwan, is universally valid. 

... how to establish good government? Good government means a government that considers itself a trustee of the people, whether you are king, chief, or whatever, not somebody in temporary charge and insecure, and therefore out to settle an annuity and a nest egg for yourself, which is what has happened in so many countries. So if you asked me what my thoughts on decolonization are, I think they are grim, because western political scientists have not lived in these societies, have not understood that what is required is economic progress, development, and the final blossoming of a large educated middle class, which alone can sustain a democracy. When you have sixty to seventy percent of your population educated, knowing what will work and what will not work, then One Man One Vote makes sense.

Supposing we have made Mandarin our first language, then I tell you, apart from domestic troubles with our Malays and our Tamils that are non-Chinese, what is the use of Singaporeans to China? They don't need another 3 million Chinese speaking people. They've got 1,300 million, 23 million in Taiwan, 7 million in Hong Kong. 3 million more speaking Chinese, what value is it to them? But because we have English, because we have access to the English speaking world, and knowledge that goes with it, and the commercial and economic contexts that we have developed, and the links that we have over the years evolved with the world in general, not just the English speaking world, but the world that now uses English as a common language. That's why we are useful.
