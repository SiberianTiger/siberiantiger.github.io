Recently, I started toÂ use an external keyboard on the Mac OS, which means that I had to give up the convenience of the touchpad. In the meantime, this is a chance to pick up the many keynoard shortcuts which I otherwise would not feel the urge to learn.

## OS X 

- Close an app: `Cmd` + `Q`
- Switch desktops: `Ctrl` + `LeftArrow` / `RightArrow`
- Mission control: `Ctrl` + `UpArrow`
- App expose: `Ctrl` + `DownArrow`
- Launch an app on dock: `Ctrl` + `F3`

------

## VS Code

- Open Markdown preview: `Ctrl` + `K` then `V`
- Go to beginning of line: `Home`
- Go to end of line: `End`
- Go to previous page: `PageUp`
- Go to next page: `PageDown`

------

## Web browser

- Close this tab: `Cmd` + `W`
